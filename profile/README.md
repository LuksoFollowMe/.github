# FollowMe
The FollowMe dApp is built for content creators, businesses, projects, and individuals who want to grow their presence within the Universal Profile and Universal Everything ecosystem. It enables follow-to-earn campaigns where new followers are rewarded with LYX or another token of your choice.

**User Flow:**
1. A user clones the FollowMe dApp to their own Universal Profile.
2. They configure the campaign: set the total reward amount and how much each follower will receive.
3. Visitors to the profile see the active campaign and can follow via the mini-app or the Universal Everything follow button.
4. New followers automatically receive a reward â€” but only once per profile (no abuse through follow/unfollow loops).
5. The campaign automatically ends when the total allocated tokens have been distributed.
